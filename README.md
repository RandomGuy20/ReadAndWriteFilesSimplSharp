# ReadAndWriteFilesSimplSharp
This will write a file if it does not exist, or overwrite the file if it does exist. I also attached the accompanying Simpl+ module. 


File Change Monitor class lives in ReadWriteFile in SIMPl - if a tech makes a change and uploads it, the system will notice the change in the hash and re populate the simpl+ module.
